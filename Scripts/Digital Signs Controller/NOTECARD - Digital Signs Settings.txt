//  This is a template notecard containing the current settings information for all Digital Signs on the region.
//  Each Digital Sign has an ID in it's prim Description field in the format ID: MyStringID
//  In this notecard you can target one or more Digital Sign IDs and send them settings data.
//  The format is:
//  MyStringID : TextureUUID
//   ....one per line. MyStringID is the Sign's ID string, TextureUUID is the UUID of a texture that the sign should display.
 
//  The data below is what is in the region at the moment and is provided as a template.
//  You should edit this notecard to substitute new settings for each sign ID, then rename it to 'Digital Signs Settings'
//  before you *replace* it back in the Controller's inventory.
//  Please look out for signs that currently have the same ID, but different textures.
//  You'll *will* need to fix the ID on these signs locally if you're sure the textures should be different, because we'll
//  overwrite them all by the (last) ID read from this file when you hit the 'Program' button!
